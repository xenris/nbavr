Non-blocking AVR.

Created by Henry Shepperd (hshepperd@gmail.com)

## About

A C++ library and real time operating system for 8-bit AVR microcontrollers (such as those found on Arduinos).

## Aims

* Reliable.
* Efficient.
* Simple.
* Light weight.
* No blocking functions.
* Non-preemptive multitasking.
* Mitigate software lockups.
* Compatible with as many AVR chips as possible.
* High level hardware abstraction with low overhead.
* Entirely made up of header files.

## Status

Beta

The code is mostly stable, some things may not work, things will change, and more things will be added.

## Using this library

See [nbos-project-template](https://github.com/xenris/nbos-project-template).

## Documentation

[Documentation](docs/index.hpp.md) is limited, but there should be enough to get started.

## Devices included

* atmega328p
* atmega8

## License
