Non-Blocking Library.

Created by Henry Shepperd (hshepperd@gmail.com)

## About

nblib is a high level, zero overhead, type safe C++ library for AVR and ARM microcontrollers.

## Goals

* Reliable.
* Efficient.
* Simple.
* Type safety.
* Maximise compile time errors, minimise run time errors.
* No blocking functions.
* Mitigate software lockups.
* Easily extendable to other microcontrollers.
* High level hardware abstraction with zero overhead.

## Example

See the [template project](https://github.com/xenris/nblib-project-template)

## Status

Beta

The code is mostly stable, some things may not work, things will change, and more things will be added.

## Using this library

See [nblib-script](https://github.com/xenris/nblib-script)

## Documentation

[Documentation](docs/index.hpp.md) is limited, but there should be enough to get started.
